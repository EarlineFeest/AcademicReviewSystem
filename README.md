# Academic Review System

A decentralized privacy-preserving peer review platform for academic research evaluation, built on blockchain technology with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for anonymous voting.

## üéì Core Concept

**Academic Peer Review Voting - Privacy-Preserving Peer Review System**

This revolutionary system transforms traditional academic peer review by implementing anonymous voting mechanisms that protect reviewer privacy while maintaining transparency and integrity in the evaluation process. Researchers can submit papers for review, experts provide anonymous feedback with encrypted scores, and the academic community benefits from unbiased, privacy-protected scholarly evaluations.
